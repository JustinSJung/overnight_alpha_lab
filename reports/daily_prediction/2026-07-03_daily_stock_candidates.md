ML dataset: `data/processed/ml_dataset_20260703.csv`

## Important Notice

This report is generated for research and portfolio purposes only. It is not financial advice or a buy/sell recommendation.

## Method

Candidates are ranked using a rule-based score that combines event score, news sentiment, news attention, prediction direction, simple risk filters, historical confidence adjustments, event-type performance adjustments, and stock-specific historical pattern adjustments.

## Stock-Specific Pattern Adjustment

The recommender now applies a stock-specific historical adjustment. Stocks with relatively positive historical reactions can receive a small positive adjustment, while stocks with weak historical reactions can receive a conservative penalty.

## Error-Note Learning Adjustment

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| convertible_bond | 12 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 0.00 |

## Risk / Avoid Review List

No candidates in this section.

## Data Readiness

At this stage, candidates are still generated using rule-based scoring. The system now also uses historical error-note patterns, event-type performance statistics, and stock-specific historical reaction patterns. These adjustments will become more meaningful after enough evaluated event-reaction samples are accumulated.

## How to Read This Report

- Positive Candidates: relatively favorable event and news conditions.
- Volatile Watchlist: potentially important events with uncertain direction.
- General Watchlist: events worth monitoring but not strong enough for positive classification.
- Risk / Avoid Review List: negative or high-risk events such as capital increases, CB/BW, lawsuits, or disclosure violations.
- Error-note adjustment score: learning signal from previous advanced error notes.
- Event-type performance adjustment score: success-rate and average-return based adjustment by event type.
- Stock-specific pattern adjustment score: success-rate, average-return, and confidence-bias adjustment by stock code.

## Next Step

The next step is to add market index and sector movement features, so the system can distinguish stock-specific signals from broader market movement.
