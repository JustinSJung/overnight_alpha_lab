# Learned-Rule Daily Candidate Report - 2026-08-10

## Purpose

This report applies learned event-rule score adjustments to the daily candidate scoring formula.

The current v4 score formula is:

```text
base_event_score
+ market_adjusted_score_adjustment
+ trading_volume_score_adjustment
+ learned_event_score_adjustment
= final_learned_rule_score
```

This report is for research and portfolio demonstration purposes only. It is not investment advice.

## Summary

- Total candidate rows: **363**
- Rows with active learned-rule adjustment: **0**

## Interpretation

- Positive learned-rule adjustments mean that the event type has historically performed better.
- Negative learned-rule adjustments mean that the event type has historically performed worse.
- If active learned-rule rows are zero, the system is still waiting for enough evaluated cases.
- This layer is conservative and does not overwrite the original event scoring rules.
