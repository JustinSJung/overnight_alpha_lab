The current v4 score formula is:

```text
base_event_score
+ market_adjusted_score_adjustment
+ trading_volume_score_adjustment
+ learned_event_score_adjustment
= final_learned_rule_score
```

## Interpretation

- Positive learned-rule adjustments mean that the event type has historically performed better.
- Negative learned-rule adjustments mean that the event type has historically performed worse.
- If active learned-rule rows are zero, the system is still waiting for enough evaluated cases.
- This layer is conservative and does not overwrite the original event scoring rules.
